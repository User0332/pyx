# Python XML

Kind of like JSX but with Python. This repository will also include `pysite`, a library to be used with PYX and Flask, basically filling in the place of React. Create your project in `test_proj`, with app.pyx being your main application. Then, with the root directory of the repo added to PYTHONPATH, `src/` added to PATH, and Flask installed, run the command `python -m pysite run` inside of your project directory to deploy your app using Flask. If you want to create a new project, use the command `python -m pysite new {projectname}`.
